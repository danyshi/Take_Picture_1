Take_Picture_1
==============
This is application is an attempt to take a picture and save it on the device harddrive. This particular code tries to implement the steps taken on the Android Developers tutorial website we have been using. The particular link to this tutorial is: http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html. I cannot tell if it works completely due to the inability to actually take a picture and access the "camera".
